About
Daily Journal App is a simple journaling platform where users can add, view, and delete their daily journal entries. It also features sentiment analysis, which classifies entries as positive, neutral, or negative based on their content. The app is built with React on the frontend, Node.js/Express on the backend, and MongoDB for database storage.
